# Ahmed Hindy

**VFX Pipeline Developer**
`USD` • `Python` • `AYON` • `Kitsu` • `Houdini` • `Arnold`

---

I build production-ready VFX pipeline tools with a strong focus on **USD-centric workflows**, **Houdini/Solaris**, and **studio pipeline integration**. 

I have hands-on experience integrating **CGWire Kitsu** and **AYON**-style workflows into real production pipelines, bridging asset management, automation, and DCC tools in scalable studio environments.

My work is focused on solving production challenges: asset standardization, material interoperability, automation, and reliable deployment across teams.
